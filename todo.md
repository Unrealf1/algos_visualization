+ Read algorithms code
* Improve visuals
    + Change 'visited' color
    - Fix streching when maze has different proportions from display
- Add more algorithms
    -   Add option to allow diagonals (with or without surrounding free paths)
    -   ARA
    -   Another one from AI :)
* Add more maze generation options
    +   Add "slower" tiles - to show difference between Dijkstra and BFS
    -   Research

    *   Load premade maze
        +   save/load functions
        -   extract save file to config parameter
        -   Interface to create maze?
- Prove all the algorithms
- Compile a video(s) / posts
- Turn this into a screensaver!
